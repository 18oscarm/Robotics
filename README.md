# Robotics Coursework Projects

This repository contains two major projects completed as part of the **University of Bristol's Robotics** unit.

## 1. Individual Project â€“ Magnet Detection & Return Navigation
Designed and programmed an **autonomous robot** capable of detecting a **magnet** and accurately returning to its **starting point**.  
This project demonstrates a **well-structured embedded C++ codebase** with strong focus on **robust control** and **sensor integration**.

- **Precise Sensor Calibration & Navigation Algorithms** â€“ ensured repeatable, high-accuracy performance in real-world tests.  
- **Finite State Machine (FSM)** â€“ managed the robot's operational workflow, including magnet search, detection, and return navigation.  
- **PID Motor Control** â€“ provided precise, dynamic motor speed regulation for smooth and accurate movement.  
- **Complementary Filter Integration** â€“ improved magnetometer heading estimation, reducing drift and sensor noise.  
- **Object-Oriented Codebase** â€“ modular classes for sensors, motors, and kinematics improved maintainability and readability.  
- **Result:** Awarded **100%** for the project, assessed by the robot's performance on a video.

## 2. Group Research Project â€“ Autonomous Box Pushing with Arduino Robots

Researched and tested the box-pushing performance of one and two **Pololu 3Pi+** robots under varying conditions.  
Led the **programming** and control system design for the project.

- **PID Motor Control** â€“ Built independent PID controllers for each motor, plus an optional **bumper-sensor feedback** mode for real-time trajectory correction.
- **Noise Filtering** â€“ Added an **exponential moving average filter** to smooth sensor data and improve stability.
- **Sensor Calibration** â€“ Wrote calibration routines to ensure consistent bumper readings across tests.
- **Performance Metrics** â€“ Developed measures such as **Path Deviation Score (PDS)** and **Frequency of Correction** to quantify control accuracy.

- **Independently taught myself Python OpenCV** for computer vision tracking, successfully integrating it into the data analysis pipeline to measure the *Path Deviation Score (PDS)* â€” a custom metric quantifying straight-line pushing performance.  
- Findings included:  
  - Pushing performance generally increases with mass for both systems.  
  - A single robot outperformed two robots at certain mass ranges (185â€“230g).  
  - Bumper-sensor feedback improved performance for two-robot systems but had limited impact on single robots.  
- Awarded a **group grade of 72%**, with feedback highlighting:
